# Riemann

A couple of functions.

One plots the value of the Riemann sum as a function of the power p, for a given number of iterations. This allows you to see how it nicely diverges as it gets close to 1.

The other function plots the value of the sum as a function of the number of terms in the sum, for a given power p. The calculation stops when the i-th increment becomes 0.01% of the total value of the sum.
